### Wait, what?
This is my unix implementation W.I.P
Enjoy your stay 3:
### But.. how do I even..?
`make init && make`
that's all you need to compile the sources
## Cross-toolchain
Every Makefile has it's own CC and stuff so find them and change to suit your needs
## Running the code
### Qemu
`make run` runs the kernel in normal mode<br>
`make run-debug` runs kernel compiled by `make debug`
### Real hardware
If you have one then Good Luck m8
<br>
That's basically it. Keep in mind that this is W.I.P ;)
